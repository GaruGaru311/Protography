Protography (Project for Mobile development course)

Our photography social app is the perfect platform for photographers to share and save their work. With our app, you can easily upload your photos and include important information about each shot, such as the location, camera settings, and any other details you'd like to remember. Not only can you save your own photos, but you can also explore the work of other photographers and get inspired by their creativity. You can follow your favorite photographers, leave comments and likes on their photos, and even join photography-themed groups and communities.
Whether you're a professional photographer or just enjoy taking photos as a hobby, our app is the perfect place to share your passion and connect with other like-minded individuals.
