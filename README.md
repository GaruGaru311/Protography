Protography (Project for Mobile development course)

App that allows the user to upload photos and consult those of other users. For each photo, the user will add information to allow others to replicate it in the best way (equipment used / time of day / location etc ...). To access the information there will be a dedicated page that can be reached by selecting the photo. The photos can be chosen from a map (also with search or geolocation function) or from a house containing the best ones. The user will have the possibility to save his favorite photos in a wishlist or to view the photos he has uploaded. "The idea is to allow non-professionals to be able to take pictures in the best possible way"
